Local development (Windows / PowerShell)
1) Create & activate a venv
From the project root (where requirements.txt exists):

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Database setup
This project is configured for PostgreSQL in studyapp/studyapp/settings.py.

Make sure Postgres is running and the credentials in DATABASES match your environment.

4) Run migrations
cd .\studyapp\
python manage.py migrate
5) (Optional) Create test users
See studyapp/TEST_USERS.md:

python manage.py create_test_users
6) Run the server
python manage.py runserver
Open:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/study/home/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/account/login/
Configuration notes
Redis / Channels layer:
REDIS_URL environment variable enables Redis-backed channel layer
If not set, the project uses an in-memory channel layer (fine for local dev)
Static + media:
Static files: studyapp/public/static/
Media uploads: studyapp/public/media/
Repo notes / status
The todo and writing Django apps currently contain placeholder models.py/views.py, but dashboard templates still reference “writings”, “payment history”, etc. That means some UI sections may be present even if the backend logic is minimal/incomplete.
